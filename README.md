# HeapSort

index.html visualises how Heap Sort works in general

algorithm.js is a possible Javascript implementation

## Basic idea
Heap Sort is part of the family of tree sort algorithms.
The trick is to not create a tree but to interprete a linear array as tree.
The word 'heap' has nothing to do with memory storage here.
